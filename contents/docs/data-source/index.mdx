In automated web testing, one powerful approach to enhance test coverage and reusability is **data-driven testing**. In **Robonito**, we make this possible through a feature called **Data Source**.

---

## What is a Data Source?

A **Data Source** is an external file — typically an **Excel (.xlsx)** or **CSV (.csv)** — that contains a list of values used to fill in input fields across various test cases.

Instead of writing multiple test cases for different input values, you can **record a test case once** and run it multiple times with various data values being pulled from a Data Source.

---

## Objective

Our goal with Data Source is simple:

> **Record once, reuse many times.**

You only need to record a single test case, and then:

1. **Upload a Data Source file** containing test values.
2. **Configure how the test case should be executed** using these values.
3. Robonito automatically fills the test case input fields with each data row from the data source and executes it.
4. **Review the results** in a detailed report.

---

## Configuration Options

You can control how Robonito uses your Data Source using two strategy types:

### 1. Sequential Strategy

- Use this when you want to **execute the test case in order**, from a specific range in the data file.
- Example: Use rows 1 to 10 only.
- Every row in that range will be used once.

```yaml
strategy: sequential
range:
  starting row: 1
  ending row: 10
```

### 2. Random Strategy

- Use this when you want to randomly pick data rows and execute the test case multiple times.
- You only need to specify how many times the test case should run.

```yaml
strategy: random
execute count: 5
```

## Supported File Types

- .csv (Comma-Separated Values)
- .xlsx (Excel File)

Each row in your file should represent a unique data set, and each column maps to the input fields or parameters in your test case.
