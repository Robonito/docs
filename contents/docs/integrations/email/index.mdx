## Understanding Email Integration

Integrating Robonito with your email account via **IMAP** lets Robonito read incoming emails. This is super handy for automating test cases that need **One-Time Passwords (OTPs)** or other info sent by email. Robonito can grab the necessary data and use it in your tests.

**Steps:**

2.  **Select Email:** Find the Email option and hit the `Connect` button to start.

3.  **Enter Connection Details:** A form will pop up. You'll need to enter this info:
    * **Email Address:** The email Robonito will connect to.
    * **Password:** Your email account's password.
    * **IMAP Server:** Your email provider's IMAP server address (e.g., `mail.sofyrus.com`).
    * **IMAP Port:** The IMAP server's port number (usually `993` for secure connections).

4.  **Connect:** After filling everything in, click `Connect`, a notification will appear indicating success or failure.

5.  **Confirm Integration:** On the Integrations page, the Email integration status will automatically show as `Connected` for your workspace.

## Reading OTPs from Mail

Once your Email integration is set up, you can easily fetch OTPs directly from emails during your test case execution.

**Steps:**

1.  **Select a Test Case to Record:** Choose the test case where you need to read an OTP. Start recording your test.

2.  **Navigate to OTP Page:** During your test recording, navigate to the page that requires the OTP.

3.  **Click "Fetch OTP" in the Toolbar:** Once you are on a page that requires OTP, click the "Fetch OTP" button on the Robonito toolbar.

4.  **Select "Email" in the Dialog Box:** A dialog box will appear. From the available options, select "Email" as your OTP source.

5.  **Enter OTP Mail Subject:** In the provided field, enter the exact subject line of the email containing the OTP. This helps Robonito locate the correct email.

6.  **OTP Detection and Filling:** Robonito will automatically detect the OTP field on the current page and populate it with the fetched OTP from the email.
