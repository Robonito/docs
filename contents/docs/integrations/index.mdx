## Understanding Robonito Integrations
Integrations allow you to connect Robonito with other tools you use daily, streamlining your workflows and keeping all project activities connected.

**Important:** Integrations are specific to each **workspace**. This means every Robonito workspace will have its own separate set of integrations.

## Accessing Integrations
To manage your integrations, simply click on **"Integrations"** in the sidebar of your Robonito dashboard.

## Supported Integrations
Robonito supports several popular integrations:

* [**Jira**](./integrations/jira):
    * Create issues directly in Jira from Robonito. This is useful for logging bugs or tasks identified during test executions.
* [**Email**](./integrations/email):
    * Give Robonito access to your email. This allows Robonito to read **one-time passwords (OTPs)** from your emails, which is useful for automating test cases that require an OTP for verification.
* [**GitHub**](./integrations/github):
    * Trigger Robonito tests automatically based on events in your GitHub repositories. You can set up triggers for:
        * **Pull Request:** Run tests when a new pull request is opened or updated.
        * **Push:** Execute tests after code is pushed to a branch.
        * **Merge:** Initiate tests when changes are merged into your main branches.
* [**Authenticator Apps**](/authenticator-apps):
    * Robonito supports popular authenticator applications (like Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator). This allows it to generate and use **one-time passwords (OTPs)** from these apps to automate test steps that require them for verification.

These integrations help you connect Robonito seamlessly with your existing development and testing ecosystems, making your automation journey more efficient and collaborative.
