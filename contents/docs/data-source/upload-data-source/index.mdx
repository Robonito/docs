### 3. Preview Uploaded Data

- After uploading, you’ll see a **preview of the data** in a table format.
- The table allows:
  - **Scrolling** through rows and columns
  - **Searching** values with a fast and responsive search box
  - A clean and easy-to-read structure so you can verify your data before applying it

## Supported File Types

- `.csv` – Comma-Separated Values
- `.xlsx` – Excel Spreadsheet

Each row represents a data entry that can be used in your test case execution.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure your data file has **header columns** (e.g., `email`, `password`) that match the placeholders used in your recorded test case.
- Avoid special characters or merged cells in Excel for better compatibility.
- Use the preview table to verify data integrity before running your test.

Now that you've uploaded your data source, you're ready to [Apply Data Source On Test Case](apply-data-source) for your test cases.

Happy testing with **Robonito**!
