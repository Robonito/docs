# Creating an API Test Case

An API test case in Robonito groups one or more API requests together to test a specific scenario or workflow.

### Prerequisite

Before creating an API test case, ensure you have already created an API suite to contain it. If you haven't, see [How to Create an API Suite](../suites).

### Steps to Create an API Test Case

1.  **Open Test Explorer:** Navigate to the dashboard page and click the second icon in the sidebar to open the test explorer.

2.  **Access Suite Menu:** In the test explorer's suite list, locate the API suite where you want to add the test case. Click the action menu button (usually represented by three dots or similar) associated with that suite.

3.  **Add Test Case:** From the action menu, select the **Add Test Case** option. A modal window or form will appear. Fill in the required details for your new test case (e.g., name, description) and confirm its creation.

4.  **Add Initial Request:** Once the test case is created, it will likely be empty. To make it functional, you need to add at least one API request. Click the **Add Request** button. A request holds all the configuration details for a single API call (URL, method, headers, body, etc.) within the test case.

### âœ… What's Next?

You have successfully created an API test case and added an initial request. The next step is to define the specifics of that request.
