Once youâ€™ve uploaded a **Data Source** (CSV or Excel), the next step is to **connect it to your test case**. This allows you to dynamically fill test inputs using the values from your data file.

---

## Steps to Apply Data Source

### 1. Go to Test Explorer

- From the Robonito dashboard, navigate to the **Test Explorer**.
- Select the test case you want to apply the data source to.

### 2. Select an Input Node

- Click on any test step where data needs to be filled (e.g., a `Fill Input` node).
- A panel will open where you can edit the **Fill Input Value**.

## How to Insert a Data Source Value

In the **Fill Input Value** field:

- Start typing `[[` â€” this will open a popup showing all the **uploaded data sources**.
- Select a **file name** from the list.
- Once selected, a second popup will appear to **select a column name** from that data source.
- After selecting the column, the expression will automatically complete like this:

```text
[[filename.columnName]]
```
- Example

- If your uploaded file is users.csv and it has a column email, your field value would be:

```text
[[users.email]]
```

![Select Data Source Column](/data-source/fill-data-source-column.png)

- This tells Robonito to use the value from the email column for each row when executing the test case.

## Things to Remember

- The popup only appears when you start typing [[.
- The file name and column name must match exactly with what was uploaded.
- You can preview and verify the data before running the test case.


Once done, you can move on to [Configure Execution Strategy](configure-test-case) to define how many times the test should run using the data source values.

Happy testing with Robonito! ðŸŽ‰
