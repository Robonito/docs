description: Learn how to configure data source execution strategies in Robonito for your test cases.
---

After uploading and applying a **Data Source** to your test case, the next step is to **configure how the test case should execute** using that data.

Robonito allows you to define an **execution strategy** to control how many times and in what way your test case should run with the uploaded data.

---

## Steps to Configure Execution Strategy

### 1. Open Test Explorer

- Go to the **Test Explorer** from the Robonito dashboard.
- Select any test case that you want to configure.

### 2. Click the Execute Button

- In the top menu bar, click the **Execute** button.
- This will open a **drawer** listing all available browser configurations (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### 3. Select a Configuration to Edit

- Click on any of the listed configurations.
- A new **drawer** will open to edit the selected configuration.

## Apply Data Source Configuration

In the configuration drawer:

1. Click on the **"Apply Data Source"** option.
2. This will show the **Data Source Strategy Configuration Panel**.
3. Choose a strategy and fill the necessary details.

## Available Execution Strategies

### 1. Sequential Strategy

Run the test case in the **exact order of rows** from the data source.

- Use when you want to test specific rows.
- You can specify a **range** of rows.

- Example:

```yaml
strategy: sequential
range:
  start: 1
  end: 10
```

- This will run the test case from row 1 to row 10 of the data source.

### 2. Random Strategy

Run the test case using random rows from the data source.

- Use when you want to simulate random behavior.
- Just specify how many times the test case should execute.

- Example:

```yaml
strategy: random
times: 5
```

- This will execute the test case 5 times, picking random rows each time.

## Final Step

Once you've configured the strategy:

- Click Save or Update on the configuration.
- Now when you execute the test case, Robonito will run it using the selected strategy and data source values.
