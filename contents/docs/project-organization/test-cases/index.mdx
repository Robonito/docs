# Introduction to Test Cases in Robonito

Test cases are the individual units of testing within Robonito. They define the specific steps and expected outcomes for verifying a particular functionality or feature of your application. Robonito supports both API and UI test cases, allowing you to cover a wide range of testing scenarios.

**Test Case Types:**

* **API Test Cases:** Verify the functionality and performance of your application's APIs.
* **UI Test Cases:** Simulate user interactions with your application's user interface to ensure proper functionality and usability.

**Adding Test Cases to a Suite:**

Test cases are added within suites, allowing you to organize your tests based on functionality, modules, or other relevant criteria. The type of test cases you can add to a suite depends on the suite type (Web or API).

**Adding a UI Test Case to a Web Suite:**

1.  **Select a Web Suite:**
    * Navigate to the suite management module and select the web suite in which you want to add a test case.
2.  **Access Add Test Case Option:**
    * Click the three vertical dots (ellipsis) on the right of the suite name (next to the play icon).
3.  **Open Add Test Case Dialog:**
    * Select "Add test case" from the suite actions menu.
4.  **Add Test Case Dialog (Add-Test-Case-Dialog.png):**
    * The "Add test case" dialog box will appear.

        ![Add Test Case Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robonito/docs/refs/heads/main/public/AddTestCaseDialog.png)

5.  **Enter Test Case Name:**
    * Provide a descriptive name for your test case in the "Test case name" field.
6.  **Enter Description (Optional):**
    * Provide a brief description of the test case in the "Description" field.
7.  **Add Test Case:**
    * Click the "Add" button to create the test case.

**Configuring a UI Test Case:**

1.  **Test Case Configuration Screen:**
    * After adding a test case, you will be redirected to the test case configuration screen.

        ![Test Case Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robonito/docs/refs/heads/main/public/TestCaseConfigurationScreen.png)

2.  **Test Case Details:**
    * The configuration screen displays the test case name, description (if provided), and other details such as:
        * **Recorded In:** The browser used to record the test case (e.g., Chrome).
        * **Screen Size:** The screen size used during recording (if available).
        * **Created:** The timestamp when the test case was created.
        * **Last Modified:** The timestamp when the test case was last modified.
3.  **Browser Launch Options:**
    * Click the "Click here to configure browser launch options" link to customize the browser settings for test execution.
4.  **Test Case Steps:**
    * The "No steps recorded so far" message indicates that no test steps have been recorded yet.
    * You can record or manually add test steps to define the actions to be performed during the test.
5.  **Test Case Actions:**
    * The test case configuration screen also provides action buttons such as:
        * **Recorder:** Start recording test steps.
        * **Configure:** Configure test case settings.
        * **Execute:** Execute the test case.
        * **Logs:** View execution logs.
6.  **Changes Saved Confirmation:**
    * After making changes to the test case, a "changes saved successfully" message will appear at the bottom of the screen.

**Test Case Configuration Drawer:**

![Test Case Configuration Drawer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robonito/docs/refs/heads/main/public/TestCaseConfigurator.png)

* **Configure Test Case:**

    * Enter the URL of the application under test.
* **Screen Size:**
    * Set the screen size for the browser during test execution.
* **Pageload Timeout:**
    * Set the maximum time to wait for the page to load before timing out.
* **Record Video:**
    * Choose whether to record a video of the test execution (Always, Never, or On Failure).
* **Capture Network Traces:**
    * Choose whether to capture network traces during test execution (Always, Never, or On Failure).
* **Capture Browser Console:**
    * Choose whether to capture browser console logs during test execution (Always, Never, or On Failure).
* **Save Configuration:**
    * Click the "Save" button to save the test case configuration.

**Test Case Recording Options:**

![Test Case Recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robonito/docs/refs/heads/main/public/RecordingOptions.png)

* **Recorder:**
    * After configuring the test case, the recording options are enabled.
    * Click the "Recorder" button to access the recording options.
* **Recording Methods:**
    * Robonito provides multiple methods for recording test cases:
        * **Record & Playback:** The traditional method of recording user interactions and replaying them during test execution.
        * **AI Recorder:** Use Robonito's AI Assistant to automatically generate test cases based on user interactions and application analysis.
    * **Future Options:**
        * Robonito will add more options in the future, such as:
            * Generating test cases from specifications or user stories.
            * Uploading manual test cases for automation and execution.

![API Test Case Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robonito/docs/refs/heads/main/public/APITestCase.png)

* After adding an API test case, you will be redirected to an interface that is familiar to most QA Engineers.
* This interface provides a code-less environment to configure and define assertions for API test cases.
* You can specify the API endpoint, request method, headers, request body, and expected response.
* Assertions can be defined to validate the response status code, headers, and body content.
