# Using Variables in API Testing

Variables allow you to make your API tests more dynamic and reusable by substituting placeholder values at runtime. This is particularly useful for managing environment-specific configurations (like base URLs) or data that changes between test runs.

## Current Support: URL Variables

Currently, Robonito supports variable substitution directly within the **API endpoint URL**.

### Syntax

To use a variable within the endpoint URL, enclose the variable name in double curly braces:

```
{{variable_name}}
```

### Example

Imagine you have an environment variable named `baseURL` set to `https://api.yourapp.com/v1`. You can use this variable in your request URL like this:

```
{{baseURL}}/users/{{userId}}
```

During execution, Robonito will replace `{{baseURL}}` with `https://api.yourapp.com/v1` and `{{userId}}` with the current value of the `userId` variable (assuming it's also defined).

*(Note: Explain where variables like `baseURL` and `userId` are defined, e.g., in Environment settings.)*

## Upcoming Enhancements

We are actively working to expand variable support to other parts of the API request configuration:

-   **Request Body:** Using variables within JSON payloads or form data.
-   **Authentication:** Referencing variables for dynamic tokens or credentials.
-   **Headers:** Using variables in request header values.

Stay tuned for future updates that will enhance the flexibility and power of your API tests in Robonito.
