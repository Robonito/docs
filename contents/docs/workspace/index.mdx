## Workspace Creation

Upon your first login, or when you need to create a new project environment, you'll be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a dedicated area for your automation projects, allowing you to organize and manage your tests, configurations, and resources effectively.

**Workspace Creation Process:**

1.  **Access Workspace Creation:**
    * If you are a new user you will be automatically prompted to create a workspace.
    * Alternatively, you can create a new workspace by clicking the dropdown menu located next to the Robonito logo in the top left corner of the dashboard.
2.  **Workspace Creation Screen (Workspace-Creation.png):**
    * You will be presented with a form to enter the following information:
        * **Workspace Name:** Provide a descriptive name for your workspace.
    * **Create Workspace:**
        * After entering the workspace name, click the "Create" button to create your workspace.
        * You can go back to the dashboard by clicking "Back" button.
    * **Workspace Creation Screen:**

Once your workspace is created, you'll be redirected to the dashboard, and your newly created workspace will be active. You can then begin using Robonito's features to build and execute your automation tests.

## Workspace Management - Team Members and Features

After creating a workspace in Robonito, you can collaborate with your team by inviting them to join the workspace. This allows for seamless teamwork and efficient management of your automation projects.

**Inviting Team Members:**

**Steps to Invite Team Members:**

1.  **Access Team Members:**
    * Navigate to your desired workspace.
2.  **Add Member:**
    * Click the "Add member" button located in the top right corner of the "Team members" section.
3.  **Enter Email:**
    * Enter the email address of the team member you wish to invite.
4.  **Assign Role:**
    * Select the appropriate role for the team member (e.g., Member, Admin).
5.  **Send Invitation:**
    * Click the "Invite" or "Send" button to send the invitation.

**Key Features of a Workspace:**

* **Logical Separation:** A workspace acts as a logical container for each testing project within Robonito. This ensures that projects are organized and isolated from each other, preventing conflicts and improving manageability.
* **Suite Management:** Test suites created in the test creation module are tied to a specific workspace. This allows for easy organization and management of test suites related to a particular project.
* **Execution Plans:** Each workspace has an associated execution plan that defines the number of parallel executions and monthly executions allowed. By default, users can execute a minimum of 10 tests in parallel, with a limit of 3000 monthly executions. For customized execution plans and pricing information, please contact us through the contact form on our website.
* **Integrations:** Integrations, such as JIRA, are configured at the workspace level. This means that if you integrate JIRA with Workspace A and then create a new Workspace B, you will need to configure the JIRA integration again for Workspace B. This ensures that integrations are specific to the projects within each workspace.

**Workspace Benefits:**

* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Invite team members to collaborate on projects within a shared workspace.
* **Project Organization:** Maintain clear separation between different testing projects.
* **Efficient Management:** Manage test suites, execution plans, and integrations at the workspace level.
* **Scalability:** Easily scale your testing efforts by creating multiple workspaces for different projects.

**Note:** This documentation will be updated as Robonito evolves. Stay tuned for more detailed instructions and feature guides.
