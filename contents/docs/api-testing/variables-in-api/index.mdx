title: Using Variables in API Testing
---

Variable substitution is currently supported only within the API endpoint URL.

- **In URL**: To reference variables in the endpoint, use the syntax **`{{variable_name}}`**

### Upcoming Enhancements

- Variable support within the request body.
- Variable support in authentication parameters, such as tokens.

Weâ€™re actively working on expanding variable support to more parts of the request workflow. Stay tuned for future updates that will enhance the flexibility and power of your API tests.
