## Introduction to Suites in Robonito

Suites are a fundamental building block in Robonito, serving as containers for organizing and managing your test cases within a workspace. The suite management module provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)-like interface for creating, editing, and executing your tests.

**Suite Management Interface:**

3.  **Enter Suite Name:**
    * Provide a descriptive name for your suite in the "Suite name" field.
4.  **Select Suite Type:**
    * Choose the type of suite you want to create from the "Suite type" dropdown.
    * Currently, Robonito supports two suite types:
        * **Web:** For web-based test cases.
        * **API:** For API-based test cases.
    * **Note:** In future releases, Robonito will support mobile and other suite types.
5.  **Create Suite:**
    * Click the "Create" or "Save" button to create the suite.

**Key Features of Suite Management:**

* **Suite Creation:**
    * Click the "+ new suite" button to create a new suite.
    * Suites act as logical groupings for related test cases.
* **Test Case Organization:**
    * Test cases are created and stored within suites.
    * This allows for structured organization of tests based on functionality, modules, or other relevant criteria.
* **IDE-like Interface:**
    * The suite management module provides an IDE-like interface for easy navigation and management of suites and test cases.
    * The left panel displays the list of suites and their associated test cases.
    * The main panel displays the content of the selected suite or test case.
* **Variables:**
    * Click the "(x) Variables" button to define and manage variables that can be used within your test cases.
    * Variables allow for dynamic data input and improve test maintainability.
* **Search Functionality:**
    * Use the search bar to quickly find specific suites or test cases.
* **Suite and Test Case Navigation:**
    * Expand suites to view their associated test cases.
    * Click on a test case to view or edit its content in the main panel.

**Suite List and Type Display:**

* **Suite List:**
    * The left panel of the suite management module displays a list of all suites within the current workspace.
    * Each suite is represented by its name.
* **Suite Type Indicator:**
    * To the left of each suite name, the suite type is displayed (e.g., "WEB" or "API").
    * This clearly indicates the type of test cases contained within the suite.
    * This helps users quickly identify and differentiate between web and API test suites.
* **Suite Actions:**
    * Each suite entry includes action icons or buttons, such as a "play" button to execute the suite and a "more options" icon for additional actions.

**Suite Actions and Execution:**

* **Execute Suite:**
    * Click the "play" icon (green triangle) next to the suite name to execute all test cases within the suite.
    * You can choose to execute tests locally or in the cloud.
* **Suite Actions Menu:**
    * Click the three vertical dots (ellipsis) on the right of the suite name to access the suite actions menu.
    * The menu provides the following options:
        * **Add test case:** Add a new test case to the suite.
        * **Delete Suite:** Delete the entire suite.
        * **Schedule:** Schedule the suite to run at a specific time or on a recurring basis.
        * **Report:** View execution reports for the suite.
        * **Generate code:** Generate code snippets for the suite or its test cases.

**Suite Execution Details:**

* **Local Execution:** Executes the test cases on your local machine.
* **Cloud Execution:** Executes the test cases on Robonito's cloud infrastructure.
* **Execution Reports:** Provides detailed reports on the execution status of each test case within the suite.
* **Scheduling:** Allows you to automate the execution of suites at specific times or intervals.

**Benefits of Using Suite Actions:**

* **Efficient Execution:** Quickly execute all test cases within a suite with a single click.
* **Flexible Execution Options:** Choose between local or cloud execution based on your needs.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Access detailed execution reports to analyze test results.
* **Automation:** Schedule suites to run automatically at specific times.
* **Suite Management:** Easily add, delete, and manage suites and their test cases.
* **Code Generation:** Generate code snippets to aid in test development.
