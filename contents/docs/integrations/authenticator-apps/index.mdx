## Understanding Authenticator Apps Integration

Integrating Robonito with an **authenticator app secret** allows Robonito to generate Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) automatically, just like apps such as Google Authenticator or Authy. This is useful for automating test cases that involve **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** where these types of OTPs are required. Robonito can generate the necessary OTPs and use them in your tests.

## Adding a new Authenticator App Account

> **Note:** You can create multiple authenticator app accounts in a workspace

To add a new authenticator app account, you'll need to provide the **secret key**.

**Steps:**

1.  **Go to Integrations:** In your Robonito dashboard, click **"Integrations"** in the sidebar.

2.  **Select Authenticator App:** Find the Authenticator App option and hit the `Add Account` button to start.

3.  **Enter Connection Details:** A form will pop up. You'll need to enter this info:
    * **Account Name:** A descriptive name that clearly identifies which account or site this 2FA setup belongs to(e.g., Github 2FA, CRM Login OTP).
    * **Secret Key:** The secret key provided by your 2FA service when you initially set up the 2FA (e.g., when you scan a QR code or manually enter a key).
     * **Advanced Options (Prefilled with Standard Values):**
        * **Number of Digits:** The length of the OTP (commonly 6 or 8 digits).
        * **Period:** The time interval (in seconds) for which an OTP is valid (typically 30 seconds).
        * **Algorithm:** The hashing algorithm used to generate the OTP (usually SHA-1).

4.  **Add Account:** After filling everything in, click `Save`. A notification will appear indicating success or failure.

5.  **Confirm Integration:** On the Integrations page, the Authenticator App integration status will automatically show as `Connected` for your workspace.

Once your Authenticator App integration is set up, you can easily generate and fetch OTPs directly during your test case execution.

**Steps:**

2.  **Navigate to OTP Page:** During your test recording, navigate to the page that requires the OTP.

3.  **Click "Fetch OTP" in the Toolbar:** Once you are on a page that requires OTP, click the "Fetch OTP" button on the Robonito toolbar.

4.  **Select "Authenticator App OTP" in the Dialog Box:** A dialog box will appear. From the available options, select "Authenticator App" as your OTP source.

5.  **Select Account Name:** If you have multiple accounts set up, select the account you wish to use from the dropdown list.

6.  **OTP Generation and Filling:** Robonito will generate the OTP using the configured secret key and automatically populate the detected OTP field on the current page with the generated OTP.
