## Creating a New Web Test

This guide explains how to create a new web test using Robonito.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   **A Robonito Workspace:** If you haven't created one yet, follow the guide on [how to create a workspace](/path/to/workspace/docs).
-   **A Robonito Web Suite:** You'll need a web suite to contain your test. Learn [how to create a web suite](/path/to/suite/docs) if you don't have one.

### Steps to Create a New Web Test

Follow these steps to add a new web test within your Robonito workspace:

1.  Navigate to the **Test Explorer** view in your Robonito workspace.
2.  Locate the web suite where you want to add the new test.
3.  Click the **Three dots icon [â‹®]** next to the desired web suite name.
4.  Select **Add Test** from the context menu that appears.
5.  In the "Create New Test" dialog:
    *   Enter a descriptive **Name** for your test.
    *   Provide a brief **Description** (optional but recommended).
6.  Click the **Create** button.
7.  Your new web test will now be listed under the selected web suite in the **Test Explorer**.
8.  Click on the new test's name to open it in the editor and begin defining test steps.
